This app is dedicated to all the engineers out there that understand the importance of first engaging with customers towards clearly defining their basic requirements, 
before designing a system for them to use. May this understanding spread widely and make apps like this one unnecessary...  

**_Disclaimer:_**  
Use the app at your own risk, and please donâ€™t blame us if it does not work or gives the wrong information.  
You are welcome to improve it by contacting divanvdb@sun.ac.za
